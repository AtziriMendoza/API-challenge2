# API-challenge2
This challenge is split into two parts. 

In part one, we gathered the weather data of numerous cities to determine if there is a relationship between latitude and temperature, cloudiness, humidity and windspeed as we plot these points from all the cities that were pulled. 

In the second part, we gathered and mapped the places that meet our weather criterion for vacation places and found hotels in a 10km radius of those select cities that met our criterion.

The purpose of this challenge was to successfully pull information using APIs and learning how to setup the urls in order to get the information that we need.
